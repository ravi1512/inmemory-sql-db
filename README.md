# inmemory-sql-db
Implementation of an in-memory SQL DB. Currently it supports -
1. Two Column types - String and Integers.
2. Max length of string is 20
3. Allowed value for Integer is >= -1024 and <= 1024
4. Creation of new table
5. Record insertion
6. Display existing records

I will be adding more functionality like querying, when I get more time.
